// This is the HTTP server module, it will handle the requests and responses
// Also provides utilities to parse the requests and build the response

//! HTeaPot HTTP server core.
//!
//! This module provides a multithreaded HTTP/1.1 server built for performance and ease of use.
//! It handles request parsing, response building, connection lifecycle (keep-alive)
//! and hooks.
//!
//! Core types:
//! - [`Hteapot`] — the main server entry point
//! - [`HttpRequest`] and [`HttpResponse`] — re-exported from submodules
//!
//! Use [`Hteapot::listen`] to start a server with a request handler closure.
//! ```
