There once was a server built with glee,
The name of the code was Hteapot, you see,
The load picked up, and the threads dug deep,
Oh run, my workers, run (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

She’d not been running two days nor three,
When came the call for a hundred K spree,
The captain rallied, strong and free,
He’d push her to that goal (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Before the load hit peak so high,
The workers churned     and the logs did fly,
All threads to the line, connections to try,
As requests dived down low (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

No thread did stall, no port was freed,
The captain’s code was tuned with speed,
And he belonged to the coder’s creed,
To reach that req in tow (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

For forty days or maybe more,
The benchmark fell then rose once more,
Some tests were lost, but we gained the score,
And still that load did grow (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

As far as I’ve heard, the push goes on,
The threads not killed, and the reqs not gone,
The Serverman’s words, an endless song,
To cheer the captain and crew along (aye!)

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

Soon may the Serverman sail,
To carry requests without fail,
One day, when the testing’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.
