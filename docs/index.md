# HTeaPot

**HTeaPot** is a minimal, dependency-free HTTP server written in Rust.
Its main goal is to provide a clean, low-level interface for building fast and lightweight HTTP services.

## 🚀 What is HTeaPot?

HTeaPot is inspired by the spirit of learning, simplicity, and full control.
Unlike full-featured frameworks, it doesn't try to be everything — just a solid base for HTTP.

It powers projects like:
- [Cafetera](https://github.com/az107/Cafetera) – An API Mocker
- [TeaLeaf](https://github.com/az107/TeaLeaf) – A reactive web framework

## 💡 Philosophy

HTeaPot is intentionally minimal.
We aim to:
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Stay dependency-free (unless absolutely justified)
- Keep things readable and hackable

This makes it a great choice for learning, embedded systems, or high-performance custom servers.
